### Making an individual decision

Decision making, in the traditional sense, consists in making a choice
between specific alternatives. For example, a customer might want to buy a
camera that captures photos better than a smartphone. A large
variety of camera systems exist that differ in form factor and other
characteristics. Most modern camera systems are mirrorless. 
Many different mirrorless systems cover the needs of all kinds
of photographers, whether they are beginners, advanced photographers, or
professionals. These systems differ in their sensor types and it is
important to choose among Micro Four Thirds cameras, APS-C
cameras, and full-frame cameras.

The difficulty then is to find out
which alternative is best suited for the customer. The customer might ask
an advisor for help with evaluating and comparing the alternatives according to
different criteria. For example, the sensor formats differ in crop factor, 
camera size and low-light performance. The customer might have preferences for these respective values. 
Sophisticated decision-aiding methods exist that assess and aggregate those preferences
in a consistent way. In the end, they result
into a ranking of the given alternatives. For example, the customer might prefer a
full-frame camera to an APS-C camera and an APS-C camera to a
Micro Four Thirds camera.

In Automation Decision Services, it is possible to introduce a decision node that requires the choice of one of the
three alternatives. However, it does not provide any direct means to evaluate these alternatives
to determine a ranking among them. Moreover, no built-in mechanism is present to choose the best decision according to
an arbitrary ranking. The ranking can help you craft the decision logic, 
which is shown in the next step. This first step is included to explain the difference 
and relationship between traditional decision making and the decision making supported
by Automation Decision Services.

#### Exercise

Choose your own personal ranking of the three options

 - Full-frame format
 - APS-C format
 - Micro Four Thirds format
 
It will be used to determine the decisions in the [next step](../step2/description.md).
 
#### Limitations

This approach is suited for individual decisions where each
of the alternatives can be chosen in each case. The [next step](../step2/description.md)
examines what happens if the available alternatives depend on the
specific case.
